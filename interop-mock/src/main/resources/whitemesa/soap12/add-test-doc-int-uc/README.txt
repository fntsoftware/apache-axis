The request/response messages in this folder have been designed to make the
WhiteMesaSoap12AddTestSvcTestCase in Axis 1.4 pass. The original endpoint at
www.whitemesa.net is no longer available.

Note that these messages are not compatible with the messages specified in
http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/REC-soap12-testcollection-20070427/. The reason is that the whitemesa
endpoint used doc/lit, while the endpoint in the W3C spec uses rpc/encoded.
