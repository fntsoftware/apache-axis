        <section name="Changes from 1.2rc3">
            <ul>
                <li>Tons of changes to typemapping system to better support jax-rpc1.1 and .NET</li>
                <li>Improved SAAJ 1.2 support</li>
                <li>Much better for rpc/lit and doc/lit (especially for arrays)</li>
                <li>Map schema "wrapped" arrays (with inner &lt;item&gt; elements) into arrays of the item type, instead of JavaBeans, by default.  Introduce the "-w" or "--wrapArrays" option to WSDL2Java to switch back to the earlier behavior.</li>
                <li>Fix some WS-I related bugs. Makes it easier to deploy WS-I BP compatible services.</li>
                <li>Internationalized happyaxis jsp pages.</li>
                <li>Updated to latest dependency jars. (ex wsdl4j-1.5.1.jar)</li>
                <li>Improved commons httpclient support.</li>
                <li>Support for sending and receiving multiple cookies</li>
                <li>Lots of fixes for performance enhancements (including eliminating ThreadLocal's)</li>
                <li>Improved JMX support - Start/Stop server/services and deploy/modify services</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section name="Changes from 1.2beta2">
            <ul>
                <li>When generating WSDL, don't change the scoping rules for type mappings.  In other words, use the most specific mappings just like we do for message processing.</li>
                <li>Fix problem with version string</li>
                <li>Remove JAXP interfaces (should come from jaxp.jar, not jaxrpc.jar)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section name="Changes from 1.1">
            <ul>
                <li>Preliminary SAAJ 1.2 support!</li>
                <li>Improved doc/literal support</li>
                <li>Improved handling of array types + WSDL generation</li>
                <li>More logical type mapping registration (SOAP-ENC types are in a separate registry which then delegates to the default one)</li>
                <li>Improved schema support (we deal with lists and groups now)</li>
                <li>ServiceDesc metadata is now more generic - ServiceDesc is an interface and JavaServiceDesc implements it to do specific Java processing.</li>
                <li>Throw fault when bad values for "mustUnderstand" attribute are parsed</li>
                <li>log4j.properties is no longer in axis.jar. This is to avoid conflicts
                with the configuration files in other bits of the application.</li>
                <li>Many bugfixes. See <a href="docs/svnlog.txt">docs/svnlog.txt</a></li>
            </ul>
